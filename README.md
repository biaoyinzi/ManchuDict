Manchu, a critically endangered language according to www.endangeredlanguages.com powered 
by Google. This language used to be the official language of China a hundred years ago but
now it is in a very dangerous situation. There are only about 20 native speakers 
worldwide,and all of them are senior citizens. Actually the Manchu ethnic population in 
China is over ten million, but due to many reasons like education and environment, all of 
them speak Chinese as mother language. There are some semi speakers of Manchu in China, 
they are those Manchu people who care about their own culture. The speaker number of this
language is decreasing very rapidly, but it is good to see that people are putting their
efforts into saving Manchu culture and language. This software is the one that helps new
generation Manchu to learn their own language. Thank you very much for your support!
